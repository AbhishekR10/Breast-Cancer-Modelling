# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer using various classification algorithms.

## Introduction:
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer based on patient data, facilitating early detection and intervention.

## Dataset:
The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Features include mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etc., along with the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) as the target variable.

## Approach:
The project follows a structured approach:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, etc.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distribution, correlation analysis, identifying patterns, and outliers.
3. Model Building: Training and evaluating various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, etc.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
